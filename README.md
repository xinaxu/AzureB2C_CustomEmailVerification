# Azure Active Directory B2C Custom Email Address Verification
## General Design
**Prerequisites: Javascript Access and Custom Policy**

[Azure Active Directory B2C](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory-b2c/) offers identity management solution to customers. In some of its built-in user flows such as password reset or user sign up, the email address needs to be verified through its built-in email verification system. This document provides a guidance of how to use your own email verification system to completely customize email verification experience.

Note that the code in this document is for illustration only. It needs to be hardened against a set of threats such as DDOS, replay attack, request tempering, etc. If you chose to use Azure Function, you may put those API service behind an API manager such as Azure API Manager. That will easily give you throttling and authentication capabilities.

First of all, youâ€™ll have to set up your own Email Verifier, let's call it Contoso Email Verifier. You can use Azure function as a start, use Azure table as a storage for the passcode, and any third-party email service to send emails. In this example, we use (SendGrid)[https://sendgrid.com/] as a third-party email service.

At the client-side, you can use your own Javascript to control the whole email verification experience:
1. After the user has provided an email address, the client needs to call Contoso Email Verifier to send out the code via email.
2. After the user has provided the code, the client needs to call Contoso Email Verifier to verify the code. Since Azure AD B2C needs to know if this email has been verified, the service also needs to return a verification token.

At the B2C-side, the token can be verified as a service to service call to Contoso Email verifier. The endpoint for this request needs to be configured to only allow traffic from B2C service. In this example, we use Function authentication in Azure Function and save the credential in B2C policy files. 

### User Flow Chart
![alt text](/imgs/data_flow.png)

### UI Design
1.	On the page to verify email address, a custom Javascript needs to be used to control email verification experience.
2.	There should be a verification token claim in the B2C [self-asserted technical profile](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/self-asserted-technical-profile). The textbox for the claim should be hidden from the user. After verifying the code, this value should be filled.
3.	Use original B2C Javascript to submit the form. This will also submit the verification token in the hidden textbox to allow B2C policies to verify the token using a [validation technical profile](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/validation-technical-profile) to call Contoso Email Verifier.

### User Flow
1. Self-Asserted page where the user enters email address
  1. Enter Email address and click "Send a code"
  2. Custom javascript sends ajax request to Contoso Email Verifier SendEmailVerification endpoint
    1. What's in the Request
      1. Email address
      2. CorrelationId (you can get this from UserJourneyContextProvider)
    2. What's in the Response
      1. Verification token
  3. Javascript update the UI based on the ajax response
  4. Enter the code and click "Verify"
  5. Custom javascript sends ajax request to Contoso Email Verifier VerifyCode endpoint
    1. What's in the Request
      1. Email address
      2. CorrelationId
      3. Verification token
      4. Code
    2. What's in the Response
      1. Verification token
  6. Use custom Javascript to fill the hidden textbox with verification token
  7. Click submit
2. Submit the form to Azure AD B2C
  1. Use validation technical profile to invoke a restful call to Contoso Email Verifier ValidateEmailVerification endpoint to verify the token. This is a service to service call.
    1. What's in the Request
      1. CorrelationId
      2. Email address
      3. Verification token
  2. Create user in Azure active directory
3. Issue a token

## Step-by-step setup
### Setup SendGrid email account
Goto [SendGrid](https://www.sendgrid.com/) and create an account.
#### Create API Key
Save the key to a safer place, it will be used in the future.

#### Create a dynamic email template
![alt text](/imgs/sendgrid_create_template.png)
#### Create a version for the template
![alt text](/imgs/sendgrid_create_template_version.png)
#### Set the subject and the name of the email
![alt text](/imgs/sendgrid_set_subject.png)
#### Set the dynamic content of the email
Note that the verification code is a dynamic data in the email and can be replaced by the arguments in the API request
![alt text](/imgs/sendgrid_set_content.png)
#### Test the dynamic content with test data
![alt text](/imgs/sendgrid_test.png)
#### Save the template
### Test SendGrid API
Here we test the SendGrid API using [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/), you may use other tools such as Curl.
#### Create a collection in Postman
You can share the same API key in this collection

#### Create a SendEmail request

#### Verify the email is received in your email box

### Setup Azure Table Storage
This will be used to store status information about how OTP verification. Save the access key in a safe place. It will be used in the future.

### Setup Azure Function
First we need to install the Azure Table storage client library in Azure function. Then we'll create three Azure functions triggered by HTTPs requests.
#### SendEmailVerification
Please refer to the code in [SendEmailVerification.csx](SendEmailVerification.csx). This will randomly generate a 6-digit code, send the email verification through SendGrid and save the entry in Azure Table storage. The type of the function is anonymous.
#### VerifyCode
Please refer to the code in [VerifyCode.csx](VerifyCode.csx). This will verify the code with the entry stored in the Azure Table storage and send back a verification token for future validation. The type of the function is anonymous.
#### ValidateEmailVerification
Please refer to the code in [ValidateEmailVerification.csx](ValidateEmailVerification.csx). This will be invoked by Azure AD B2C to validate the verified email using the verification token. The type of the function is Function and you need to save the access code.
#### Enable CORS
You also need to enable CORS for those Azure functions. Please refer to this [document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings#cors) for how to setup CORS. As an example, you can allow all origins by adding "\*" to the list.
### Setup Custom content
Upload [custom_content.html](custom_content.html) to your blob storage and enable CORS and public access. See this [document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/active-directory-b2c-reference-ui-customization) for more details. Note the Ajax request urls in the content need to match your Azure Function endpoints.
### Setup Custom policies
Upload [TRUSTFRAMEWORKBASE.xml](TRUSTFRAMEWORKBASE.xml), [TRUSTFRAMEWORKEXTENSIONS.xml](TRUSTFRAMEWORKEXTENSIONS.xml), [CUSTOMEMAILSIGNUP.xml](CUSTOMEMAILSIGNUP.xml) to your B2C tenant. Note, tenant name, Azure Function endpoints in the policy file needs to be modified to your own values.
### End to End Test
Run the policy. If you've setup above correctly, you will see an example of email verification through SendGrid.
